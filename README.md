# Creative Coding Challenges

### This repository stores the creative coding challenges that I have completed as a part of the ICS4U course.


#### Perlin Noise Terrain Generator
This is an adaptation of a classmate's coding challenge in which they explained how to code a Perlin Noise Terrain Generator. I didn't change too much, as it would've resulted in a broken generator, but I added a feature so that if you press on the terrain, it changes colour and slows down. It was something small, but fun, to try and I think it worked well. I also played with the numbers a little bit. It can be found on p5.js <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/alexclements63/sketches/zXtmiEQUV"> here</a>.
